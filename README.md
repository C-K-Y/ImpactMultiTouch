ImpactMultiTouch
================

This files provide multitouch functionality to [impact](impactjs.com). It works in your desktop browser, mobile browser and iOSImpact.

It consists of three parts:

1. The multitouch plugin `multitouch.js`
2. Compatibility files for iOSImpact `JS_TouchInput.*`
3. A button class that uses multitouch

In the button class you can see how to handle touches. 
There is a big difference between one touch and multiple touches. You can see the difference quite good when comparing the button class in this repo with my first one here: <https://gist.github.com/1395616>
